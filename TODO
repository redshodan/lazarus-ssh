- daemon mode
- Look for this prompt from ssh:
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
+ long args for lssh, remove need for --
- correctly grok host in session id matching.
+ if session overidden and its not a lssh style session then disable session
  management
+ if session overidden and its lssh style, then manage that session.
- have mode to choose a lost session. ncurses/urwid list choice.
- copy over tmp screenrc file. put it in /tmp, record in db, md5sum check at
  session startup. dont push again if dont need to.
- support moving sessions from one client host to another.
  - copy over .lsshdb and do the right thing
  - UI to take control and record the session in the local .lsshdb

nice to have later:
- lssh server:
  - lssh server manages ssh master connections. timeout on them.
  - lssh clients use the master connection.
  - have lssh server mediate db file management.
  - dbus support to listen for network up/down events
- sub-screen cmdkey passing. option to make it behave sanely.

bugs:
# this doesnt parse right: lssh -- -l user host
- line wrap of output watching for. looks like its a space \r that is a soft
  line wrap.
# socket.getfqdn() no worky on redhat, wtf?
