- copy over tmp screenrc file. put it in /tmp, record in db, md5sum check at
  session startup. dont push again if dont need to.
- support moving sessions from one client host to another.
  - copy over .lsshdb and do the right thing
  - UI to take control and record the session in the local .lsshdb

nice to have later:
- lssh server:
  - lssh server manages ssh master connections. timeout on them.
  - lssh clients use the master connection.
  - have lssh server mediate db file management.
- sub-screen cmdkey passing. option to make it behave sanely.
